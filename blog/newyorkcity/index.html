<p>New York City is portrayed in many different ways from the glamorous depiction in Sex and the City to the romantic. There are plenty of things to do and see without spending a fortune on tickets. Here are our top 10 free or heavily discounted things to see and do whilst in New York City.</p>
<p>1. First up free or nearly free museum access</p>
<p>The Guggenheim museum on 5th Avenue hosts art collections and special exhibitions. They have pay-what-you-wish hours ($1 min) Mondays and Saturdays, 4 pm to 5:30 pm. Advanced booking is recommended as these slots sell out fast. 
Have a Wednesday afternoon after 3pm free? Visit the New York aquarium for $0 entry (advanced booking required) and explore the wonders of the sea whilst learning about conservation, a great afternoon for the whole family. 
If art and sealife are not your thing then another free attraction is the 9/11 Memorial Museum on Mondays. Tickets go online at 7am and are first come, first serve.</p>
<p>2. Free tours and sightseeing</p>
<p>See the sights in Lower Manhattan with a free walking tour led by highly knowledgeable, licensed tour guides. Sights include Wall Street including the New York Stock Exchange, 9/11 Memorial, One World Trade building,  St Paul’s Chapel and views across the water of The Statue of Liberty. These tours run most Saturdays throughout the year and last 2.5 hours. No payment is required but you are encouraged to tip your guide at the end if you have had a good experience. 
If you want to see the Statue of Liberty a bit closer up, catch the Staten Island Ferry from South Ferry Terminal at the edge of Battery Park. It's a free service and runs every 20 minutes during peak times and every 30 minutes during quieter parts of the day. </p>

<p>3. Take in Nature and the free spaces in NYC</p>
<p>Central Park is the biggest green space in Manhattan and boasts various walking routes with lots of attractions to see along the way including The Delacorte Theater, The Shakespeare Garden, and Belvedere Castle which is great for a photo op out of the turrets. With over 800 acres it is recommended to plan a route before venturing into the park to see as many landmarks and attractions as possible. </p>
<p>4. Free Festivals and Events</p>
<p>Throughout the year NYC hosts free festivals such as the Autumn Brooklyn Book Festival and Bank of America Winter Village at Bryant Park (end of October to Early March) featuring free ice skating admission. Be sure to look out for festivals around your travel dates and make the most of the culture and entertainment they have to offer. </p>
<p>5. Hop on/Hop off bus tours</p>
<p>A great way to see the sights with a guide to point out the sightseeing opportunities. It is also a really easy way to get around the city. So if you are travelling from Lower Manhattan back to Midtown the bus will take just under 25 minutes, but if you decide to stay on for the whole loop it will take 90 minutes in total. </p>
<p>6. Broadway TKTS ticket booth</p>
<p>If you want to experience a Broadway show but are not too sure what you want to see, why not save some money and visit the TKTS ticket booth which sells same-day matinee and evening performances and next-day matinees for up to 50% off! Be sure to check the opening times as some days it is only open in the afternoon.</p> 
<p>7. Happy hour</p>
<p>If you are planning drinks or a meal between 5pm and 7pm why not take advantage of Happy Hour. Happy hour used to be synonymous with BOGOF cocktails and Beers but also extends to 2for1 sandwiches and ½ price meals. Happy hour times vary from place to place, so be sure to check out their socials or website to find out what time they have their best deals of the day. </p>
<p>8. Free viewing points</p>
<p>If you want to see the city from different angles there are loads of places across the city with awesome views you can take in for free. For views of the Statue of Liberty, there is the Statue of Liberty Vista Point located next to Battery Park. If you can’t get to the Top of the Rock or The Empire State, check out some elevated viewing points such as The High Line located in Chelsea. It is a public park built on an old freight railway. It is elevated above street level and gives views of Manhattan’s West Side. You could also take in the sites at a rooftop terrace such as the one located on the 7th floor of the Stavros Niarchos Foundation Library. </p>
<p>9. Sports Games</p>
<p>Sporting events taking place on Sundays or midweek are usually cheaper. Most sports ticket sites have dynamic pricing meaning the closer to the event you book the more expensive the ticket. Buying from secondary market apps and websites tend to be substantially more than the face value of the ticket so try to avoid this and if all else fails and you have not got your heart set on a particular game, try turning up at the event box office 1 -2 hours before the start and take advantage of a general rush ticket.</p>
<p>10. Merchandise</p>
<p>You might be tempted by the merchandise in the gift shops at the attractions, however these generally carry a much bigger price tag than some of the smaller outlets in the city. It is worth checking Duane Reed, Walgreens and Kmart stores you wouldn’t usually think of first for NYC keyring. Be sure to visit Fishs Eddy on Broadway which hosts its own museum inside where you can tour the history of this iconic gift shop. It’s not the cheapest gift shop in the city but you may find some hidden gems. </p>
