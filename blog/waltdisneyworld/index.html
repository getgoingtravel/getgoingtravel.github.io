                    <p>Souvenir shopping can be one of the most expensive parts of your trip to Walt Disney World Florida, so here are some handy tips for finding free and low cost souvenirs…</p>
                    <p>As Disney celebrates 100 years of Magic, Walt Disney World Resort in Florida is more than just four theme parks and two waterparks, it’s a world of endless shopping, dining and family fun. </p>
                    <p>Starting in Epcot you can collect Kidcot fact cards from each pavilion. They come in a little ziplock suitcase and it’s fun trying to find them at each location. The stations are either inside shops, or in more obscure areas such as the medina in Morocco.</p>

<p>Next we move to Animal Kingdom where kids can become Wilderness Explorers for the day and follow in Russell’s footsteps. They get a handbook from a cast member on the first bridge in view of the Tree of Life and explorers complete challenges, collect badges and learn wilderness skills throughout the day.</p>

<p>The next freebie souvenir on our list is available across the resort and that’s badges (buttons). Speak to cast members at park entrances, resort hotels and even the shops across the parks and let them know it’s your first visit or that you are celebrating a special occasion such as an anniversary or birthday. To be honest cast members don't seem to need a reason to give out these badges, they will personalise them and they make good keepsakes. Be prepared to be acknowledged across the resort when wearing these badges.</p><section class="post-image">

<p>Every visit we collect a set of guide maps as keepsakes. Over the years we have compared them to see how much the parks have changed with redevelopment. They are available in multiple languages at the entrance to each park, water park and Disney Springs.</p>

<p>Each visit we upgrade our popcorn with a new popcorn bucket. Remember the TV show ‘Pimp my Ride’ well this is the Popcorn equivalent. They make great souvenirs and come in all sorts of themes. They range from a bucket with a design on the side to toys including characters and Disney icons.</p>

<p>A relatively low cost collectible souvenir is the pressed pennies. There are machines across the parks and penny folders in the stores. In different parks there are different designs available and at a cost of $5 for 8 pennies you can soon get your collection up and running, you can also pay by credit card.</p><section class="post-image">

<p>Finally, one of the most iconic souvenirs has to be the autograph book. We bought ours during Walt Disney Worlds 50 Years of the Most Magical Place on Earth celebrations. You can get a book at the parks and there is lots of choice or try having something else signed such as a photo frame.</p>
